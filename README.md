ðŸ‘‹ About Me
Iâ€™m an AI Engineer & Data Scientist with hands-on experience building end-to-end machine learning and NLP solutions. I specialize in advanced AI techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LLM-based agents, leveraging Python, LangChain, and Azure AI services. With a strong foundation in deep learning, statistics, and data storytelling, Iâ€™m passionate about solving real-world problems through scalable, intelligent AI systems. I thrive in fast-paced, research-driven environments and continuously push myself to learn new skills.
ðŸš€ Selected Projects
Iâ€™ve tackled several innovative AI projects that showcase my skills:
RAG Chatbot: Developed a PDF-based Q&A chatbot using Azure AI Search and Azure OpenAI, achieving over 90% answer accuracy on technical documents.
AI Procurement Assistant: Built an AI agent with LangChain and GPT-4 to automate product search and generate dynamic procurement reports, streamlining decision-making.
Chest X-ray Classifier: Trained a CNN to detect pneumonia in chest X-rays with >98% accuracy, using advanced medical image preprocessing and deep learning.
Other Highlights: Created a real-time hand gesture controller with OpenCV & TensorFlow (for intuitive UI control), and an interactive Power BI dashboard for retail analytics (sales, inventory, customer insights).
ðŸ’¡ Skills & Technologies
My core skill set includes:
Languages: Python, SQL
Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Keras
Tools & Libraries: LangChain, OpenCV, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Power BI
Cloud & AI Services: Azure AI Search, Azure OpenAI, Streamlit (for web demos)
These skills have enabled me to build robust ML pipelines, data processing tools, and intelligent applications. Iâ€™m also experienced with prompt engineering and RAG architectures.
ðŸŒŸ Mentorship & Interests
Iâ€™m committed to community and personal growth. As a core trainer in the Google Developer Student Club at Zarqa University, Iâ€™ve led AI workshops and mentored peers in data science and software development. I also enjoy speaking at tech meetups and sharing knowledge with others. Outside of work, I thrive on continuous learning and resilience â€“ always exploring new AI techniques and taking on challenges with a growth mindset.
